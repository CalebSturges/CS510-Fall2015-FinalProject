I studied a variety of cases of the julia and mandelbrot sets.
For the Julia sets I focused on cases that either affine transformations of a given initial random seed 
as well as ones in which the the neagitve compenents where switched, by multiplying both by a negative number.

For the mandelbrot sets I zoomed in on a particular region to study its quasi-fractal properties.
